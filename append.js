The platform is constructed using google chrome's v8 javascript engine. A web application is a type of software that executes on a server and is displayed by a client's browser that obtains all the application 's resources over the internet. Compared to other server-side languages, node js has distinct advantages. Its asynchronousmodel and non-blocking I/O operation improve the scalablity and perfomrmance of web applications built on other framworks. Node.js can easily handle multiple client requests without requiring multiple threads, consuming less memory and resources. Additionally, it is high scalable and provides high perfomrmance. Node js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and makes the development process easier. compared to other server-side languages, nodejs has distinct advantages.
